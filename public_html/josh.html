<h4>
    I have made a few simple commits and copy/pasted your header for now. Look at the commit history and
    explore how it looks. You should be able to see what changed at each commit and the message with it.
    I forked your repo. Which basically means that I have cloned your repo into my own github. I then cloned that fork on
    my local machine. I have made the commits on my local repo. I am going to push the commits to the remote forked repo.
    Once I do that, I will send you whats called a "pull request" and what this means is you will be "pulling" my changes
    into the origin repo. So my added changes will then be live in yours.

    If you successfully do this and can see all my changes..  then we should try making another branch (we will
    call it "dev" for example.. so we would have a master branch and a dev branch). So you would make a dev branch..
    make some edits of your own.. commit and push those changes to the remote dev branch
    and then I will fork it and repeat the process...You will pull my commits again but this time to your dev origin branch
    and once you are satisfied. You will merge the branches.

    This link is excellent :
